## Dataset & Target

For this competition, I will be predicting a binary target based on a number of feature columns given in the data. The columns are a mix of scaled continuous features and binary features. The data is synthetically generated by a GAN that was trained on real-world molecular response data.

Files
train.csv - the training data with the target column<br/>
test.csv - the test set; you will be predicting the target for each row in this file (the probability of the binary target)<br/>
sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format<br/>
