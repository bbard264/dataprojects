## Dataset & Target

For this data, I will predict whether a customer made a claim upon an insurance policy. The ground truth claim is binary valued, but a prediction may be any number from 0.0 to 1.0, representing the probability of a claim. The features in this dataset have been anonymized and may contain missing values.

Files
train.csv - the training data with the target claim column<br/>
test.csv - the test set; you will be predicting the claim for each row in this file<br/>
sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format<br/>
