## Dataset & Target

For this dataset, I will be predicting a binary target based on 100 feature columns given in the data. All columns are continuous. The data is synthetically generated by a GAN that was trained on a real-world dataset used to identify spam emails via various extracted features from the email.

Files
train.csv - the training data with the target column<br/>
test.csv - the test set; you will be predicting the target for each row in this file (the probability of the binary target)<br/>
sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format<br/>
