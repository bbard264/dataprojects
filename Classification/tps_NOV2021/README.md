## Dataset & Target

For this dataset, I will be predicting a binary target based on 100 feature columns given in the data. All columns are continuous. The data is synthetically generated by a GAN that was trained on a real-world dataset used to identify spam emails via various extracted features from the email.

Files
train.csv - the training data with the target column<br/>
test.csv - the test set; you will be predicting the target for each row in this file (the probability of the binary target)<br/>
sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format<br/>

- There are no missing values in the dataset
- The binary output is balanced
- There are 100 continuous and independent features in the dataset.<br/>

## Analysis & Validation
- The XGBClassifier will be used for classification, as it is capable of predicting a binary target output. <br/>

## Summarization
- In this dataset, the goal is to predict a binary outcome based on 100 continuous features. There are no missing values, and the binary output is balanced. The XGBClassifier algorithm will be used to classify the data, and the AUC score after validation is 0.628. (The closer the AUC score is to 1, the better the model's performance. In this case, the AUC score of 0.628 after validation indicates that the model is performing moderately well in classifying the data.)
