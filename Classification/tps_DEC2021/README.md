# Dataset & Target

For this dataset, I will be predicting a categorical target based on a number of feature columns given in the data. The data is synthetically generated by a GAN that was trained on a the data from the Forest Cover Type Prediction. This dataset is (a) much larger, and (b) may or may not have the same relationship to the target as the original data.

Files

train.csv - the training data with the target Cover_Type column<br />
test.csv - the test set; you will be predicting the Cover_Type for each row in this file (the target integer class)<br />
sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format<br />

## Exploring Data
- The target are 'Cover_Type' that are categorical that have 7 labels<br />
- There are 53 features that have 10 continuous features and rest are binary<br />

- No relation in between feature each others<br />

- No missing values

## Feature Engineer
- There is only one record that has a target value of 5. --> Haven't infomation enogh --> Drop that record<br />
- The features Soil_Type7 and Soil_Type15 both have a value of 0. --> Can't descibe the target --> Drop these features<br />
- Now we have 6 labels in the target data and have 51 features<br />

## Analysis & Validation
- Using Random Forest Classifier that can handle this dataset that have many binary features.<br />

- AUC Score = 0.9776735630138442
## Summarization
- In this dataset, the goal is to predict one of 7 categories for the 'Cover_Type' target variable based on 53 features, 10 of which are continuous and the rest are binary. There is no relation between the features and there are no missing values. During the feature engineering process, one record with a target value of 5 was dropped because there was not enough information, and the features 'Soil_Type7' and 'Soil_Type15' were dropped because they did not contribute to describing the target. After these changes, there are 51 features and 6 labels in the target data. For analysis and validation, a Random Forest Classifier was used, which is suitable for handling this dataset with many binary features. The AUC score of 0.9776735630138442 indicates that the model is performing very well in classifying the data.<br />

- Actually, This dataset has an imbalance in the target data, which may affect the accuracy of the model. This imbalance can be addressed by using SMOTE to oversample the minority class and make the model more efficient at predicting the target. <br />
