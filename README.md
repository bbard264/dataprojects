Hello, my name is Pond.

I am new to the data field and have several projects from school and personal projects that I am working on and represent here. <br/>
I am also looking for a new job as a data analyst, with the goal of becoming a data scientist in the future. <br/>
I am interested in the field of machine learning and enjoy exploring the insights that can be gained from data and finding ways to optimize models. <br/>
I am currently studying deep learning and looking for ways to improve my knowledge in this area. <br/>
