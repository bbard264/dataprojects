# JoJoGAN: One Shot Face Stylization <br/>
JoJoGANs are a type of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that have the ability to add and style a photo using a single reference image. They require less time to train compared to other GANs. I have been experimenting with JoJoGANs to study the field of Convolutional Image in Deep Learning. For more details, please refer to the slide that I have uploaded.<br/>
